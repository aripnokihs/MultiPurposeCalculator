# MultiPurposeCalculator

Built with `Next.js` and `Shadcn/UI`.

The website offers a calculator supporting addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. It also supports biswise operations and number system conversion (binary/decimal/hex).

## Get Started
#### Must:
1. Unzip `my-app/node_modules/@next/swc-darwin-arm64/next-swc.darwin-arm64.node.zip`.
   
2. You have `npm` installed.

   
#### Might need:
1. Install the `Shadcn/UI` files 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; `npx shadcn@latest init` and `npx shadcn@latest add [component] (button, input, etc.)`


2. Intall a `React` package

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`npm install next-themes @radix-ui/react-dropdown-menu`

#### To run:
1. `cd` into `./my-app`.

2. `npm start` OR `npm run build` + `npm run start`

3. The page will be displayed at `http://localhost:3000`, navigate to this address in your browser.

## Potential Issues

1. This is a `Next.js 15 + React 19` project, which includes some different installation process for `Shadcn/UI`. Check https://ui.shadcn.com/docs/react-19 for further info.
 
2. If see `500 Internal Server Error` after `npm start`, try `2` in the `Might need` section.
   
3. If see `webpack error` after `npm run build `, also try `2` in the `Might need` section.
